# yfinance-predictor
### Here's a notebook with some data extraction/setup for a stock predictor
### In my case, I use the s&p500 index as an example and create a binary predictor variable for if the market went up or down
### Then, there are a few additional metrics created and the beginnings of what will be an XGBoost prediction model
